Main objective of this repo is to have reference code for tensorflow which will do following:

	1. save a trained tensorflow model. Restore within same program/module/jupyter session [code: digit-recognizer_v2.0_Save_Model.ipynb]
	2. restore a trained model which was saved using different program/module/jupyter session [code: digit-recognizer_v2.0_Restore_Model.ipynb]

This is a sample implementation of a CNN using kaggle digit-recognizer competition data.
